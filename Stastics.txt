# Statistics is a subfield of mathematics. It refers to a collection of methods for
# working with data and using data to answer questions.

# Descriptive Statistics:
#     Descriptive statistics refer to methods for summarizing raw
#     observations into information that we can understand and share.
# like from a given data we don't understand anything but we have mean and variance then '
# we can manage to get some info

#########
# Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics is a fancy name for methods that aid in quantifying properties of the domain or population
#     from a smaller set of obtained observations called a sample
