What ???
"""
A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction.
"""

Competitive learning is a form of unsupervised learning in artificial neural networks, in which nodes compete for the right to respond to a subset of the input data.

What is different to other method like ann ,cnn,rnn???


"""artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), """


1.self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to K-means
