# Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array
# and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays.
# SciPy builds on this, and provides a large number
# of functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful
# for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
# With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data - processing and system - prototyping
# environmen rivaling systems, such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R - Lab, and SciLab.

# Scipy is organized into subpackages covering different scientific computing domains

#################cluster##########
# Clustering algorithms are useful in information theory, target detection, communications, compression, and other areas. The vq
# module only supports vector quantization and the k-means algorithms.
