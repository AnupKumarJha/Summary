# Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python library
# providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data
# analysis tools for the Python programming language.
# The name Pandas is derived from the word
# Panel Data – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data
#################
# Prior to Pandas, Python was majorly used for data munging and
# preparation. It had very little contribution towards
# data analysis. Pandas solved this problem. Using
# Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing
# and analysis of data, regardless of the
# origin of data — load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze.
# Key Features of Pandas
#
#     Fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing.
#     Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formats.
#     Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
#     Reshaping and pivoting of date sets.
#     Label-based slicing, indexing and subsetting of large data sets.
#     Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted.
#     Group by data for aggregation and transformations.
#     High performance merging and joining of data.
#     Time Series functionality.
############################
# Pandas deals with the following three data structures −
#
#     Series
#     DataFrame
#     Panel
# These data structures are built on top of Numpy array, which means they are fast.
# serie->1D labeled homogeneous array, sizeimmutable.
# Data Frame->General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure
# with potentially heterogeneously typed columns.
# Panel=>General 3D labeled, size-mutable array.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
myarray=np.array([1,2,3])
rawname=['a','b','c']
myseries=pd.Series(myarray,index=rawname)
print("series=",myseries)
#accessing the data
print(myseries[0],myseries[1],myseries[2])
print(myseries["a"],myseries["b"],myseries["c"])
###############data frame##################
# A data frame is a multi-dimensional array w
# here the rows and the columns can be labeled.
myarray=np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
rawname=['a','b']
colname=['one','two','thre']
